1)Git init - it initializes git inside your current folder ( 1 time at the begining of the project)
2) Stage - Staging
we have to select the files which we want to keep a track of or te file which is to be used in current situation
a) the procedure to select files is called staging and to mark the files which needed to be store we use git add<filename>
to check the status use :git status
b) for storing the files inside the system : to store the files which are staged/ track we have to use a command called git commit
but remember always a commit must be follwed by a commit mssg , without commit mssg we are not allowed to save the code.also commit mssg must be meaningful.
c)next we will be renaming the master to main(1 time)
command :   git branch -M main
command :   git branch
d) we have to provide the remote repo link and save it inside a keyword that is origin
command :   git remote add origin <URL>

git add .
git push origin  UC2

to check number of branches : git branch

after writing the code :
